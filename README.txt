Firstly we three were excited to do a webpage. 
As soon as we got the topic, which is Balloons, we started doing research on the companies of balloons.
We three even had a small meeting in the class regarding the Entities.
Our teammate Simarjit has given many ideas about our companies names and even suggested important entites for our webpage.
As mentioned above we three agreed on the company name as "bAllooNiverSe". The capital A,N,S represents the initials of our team-members.
We have gathered as much as information we could about all varaities of balloons, thier sizes, shapes, occassion based balloons and prices.
As of now initially we just created a project and added the README file and once tried for the execution, it was successfully running.

Challenges:

1 SQL table

Today we three were having the same issue that was the SQL table is not getting created.
Abhinav and Narsingh has again started the whole project from starting, we actually thought that in starting the index field might having few issues, so that is why we started newly, we almost did 10 times till the step 4 for the same error, I mean the error we got was the db with the ballooniverse name was not found, so after several attempts we thought of changing our company name from ballooniverse to balloonworld.

And Yesssss we got the table, we really had no idea like why did this name got the table and not the previous one.

2. search filter

In the step 7 we almost sat for 3 hours as we were rewriting the entire models/index file again and again but got the same error and you know what actually 
we had to keep a "s" in the word "balloon" like where ever we typed balloon as the file name to return, it was supposed to be "balloons".

HURRAAAYYYYYY, we got successful with the search filter. code was running fine.


3. today(wednesday) we have worked for more that 7 hours together. 
Though we typed the codes for the previous MvcMovie project we were having the code in the tutorial and actully did not know like where it is movie or movies.
Today we are atleast some confident that we can do this type of webpages in our own way.

This lab literally helped us three to gain alot of knowledge regarding the C# coding in visual studio.

The codes which we typed for this project we have a good idea about where can we possibly get errors.

some parts like the sql errors were dificult, there we took alot of time and went through few online sites like chatgpt or bing chat and did our research  
then got to  know that even an comma or semicolon ",;" are major errors we got.

semicolons are playing a major roles in this codes.

4. Then again Abhinav started working on the README, and simarjit helped in designing the background.

We made sure that the background is totally ours. and even abhinav has created a image for the lists button.

Atlast we have successfully pushed our project into the new repository in abhinav's account and he shared it with all the teammembrs.

Hope we get love and suppport from our fellow competitors and our respected faculty.

Thank you.
